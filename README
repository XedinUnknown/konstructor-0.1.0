This is an implementation of horizontal reuse in PHP, but without using PHP 5.4
language features.

The idea is to provide a mechanism of horizontal reuse, which can be configured
with PHP in PHP. Any class that conforms to a certain set of rules is to be
used as a trait/graft in another class. However, it is important to leave the
graft class open to inherit from another class, and to require little or no
refactoring and change of logic. Setting dependencies of a class on a
per-instance basis means that some internal members are to be set. On the other
hand, the logic, which is going to enable such "inheritance", cannot be located
inside this class because of the requirements mentioned above.

The solution I see suitable is to have another class responsible for most of the
logic, where as the final class produced will have to implement a certain
interface and assign the private variables inside itself.
